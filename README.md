OOP in Spark AR by Facebook/Instagram


- In this repo thread you will find the Augmented Reality "world object" I designed for reference in the file titled "lab portal complete.arproj" 

- To run this, you will have to have Spark AR Studio installed on your pc

- for anyone who wants to learn how to do AR using Spark, I have attached the webpage's of both the a youtube tutorial (I vetted personally) that is easy to follow for creating animated 3d objects in AR as a webpage in the .html file, the link is also provided here: https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=k5JAL8qIzr0

- the other webpage saved as a .html is a website that serves as repository for free online 360 degree images that is mostly unrelated, but that I used in my AR design of the lab portal. It can also be found here: https://pixexid.com/image/wy51unh-siemens
