# Augmented-Reality
3D Modeling in Blender and Spark AR Studio


- In this repo thread you will find the Augmented Reality "world object" I designed for reference in the file titled "lab portal complete.arproj" 

- There is a video + images of the object included in the repo as well

- Otherwise, to see this 3D object and engage with it, you will need to have Spark AR Player installed on your phone to PREVIEW, or either Blender 3D or Spark AR Studio package on your pc to EDIT. Spark is free

- The accompanying files for the "lab portal" AR are in the repo probably as a .gltf file, I believe you have to download them too in order to EDIT my file. 

- For anyone who wants to learn how to do AR using Spark, I have attached the webpage's of both the youtube tutorial (I vetted personally) that is easy to follow for creating animated 3d objects in AR as a webpage in the .html file, the link is also provided here: https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=k5JAL8qIzr0

- The other webpage saved as a .html is a website that serves as repository for free online 360 degree images that is mostly unrelated, but that I used in my AR design of the lab portal. It can also be found here: https://pixexid.com/image/wy51unh-siemens
